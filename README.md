This repo contains examples from the article of mine:
["Under the hood of calling C/C++ from Python"](http://azhpushkin.me/posts/python-c-under-the-hood)

Examples are organized somewhat similar to the chapters of the article.
For compilation steps and other instructions, check out README.md 
inside of the each folder.

Don't hesitate to create an issue or PR if you something
is not working as expected.
